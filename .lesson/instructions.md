# Thanksgiving Assignment
In this lesson, you will make a unit converter.
## Instructions
* You will make a program that will ask for user input about at least three different units to convert from Imperial to Metric or vice versa.
* Choose three unit conversions (e.g. feet to meters, pounds to kilograms, etc.) and create a program that can convert one to the other.
* Give the user a menu of the conversions, and let the user select which conversion they want to make.
* Let the user enter the first number, then repeat the number back in the unit they selected.
* Calculate the conversion to the other unit, then show the result back to the user.
* If the user makes a mistake in entering a choice or first unit, use exception handling to tell them they made a mistake.
